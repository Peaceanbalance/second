<h2>Marshall Bruce Mathers III - Eminem Aka slim shady, Double M, M&M</h2>
<br>
<img src="Eminem.jpg" alt=" A picture of Eminem" width ="20%" height="50%">
<br>
<br>
<p>Aged 49 in 2022, Born in St Joseph, Missouri U.S American rapper, record producer, and actor who was known as one of the most-controversial and best-selling artists of the early 21st century.
Mathers had a turbulent childhood, marked by poverty and allegations of abuse. At age 14 he began rapping in clubs in Detroit, Michigan, and, when unexcused absences kept him in the ninth grade for the third year, he quit school, determined to make it in hip-hop music. As Eminem, he made a name for himself in the hip-hop underground, both as a solo artist and as a member of the Detroit-based rap sextet D12 (also known as the Dirty Dozen). His first album, Infinite (1996), sold poorly, however, and he continued to work menial jobs.</p> 

<p>Eminem received mixed reviews for Revival (2017), and Kamikaze (2018) was described by many critics as somewhat curmudgeonly in tone. Such criticism had little impact on sales, however, and in 2020 Music to Be Murdered By became his 10th consecutive album to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. In addition, Eminem occasionally collaborated with rapper Royce da 5'9″ under the name Bad Meets Evil; among their releases was the EP Hell: The Sequel (2011). In 2022 Eminem performed with other hip-hop stars—including Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, and Snoop Dogg—at the Super Bowl halftime show. Later that year he was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
