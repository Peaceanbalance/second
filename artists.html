<p>They went from being broke, hungry and homeless in 1993 to watching their brand of flowing, rolling, rapid-clip, harmonized rap -- dubbed the "Cleveland Sound" -- hit the top of the charts. But to get from the streets of Cleveland, to TV sets across the world, it's been a long journey for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Their rise commenced in '93 when they scraped up every penny they had for one-way bus tickets to Los Angeles determined to prove their talents to their favorite rapper, the late Eric "Eazy-E" Wright of N.W.A. As the famed story goes, they spent months living on the street, constantly trying to contact Eazy-E, until they finally received a call from him. They rapped for him over the phone, Eazy said he'd get back to them, but never did. When they learned Eazy was doing a show in Cleveland, they hustled up more money for bus tickets and headed back. They found him backstage and and gave a back stage audition in person, Eazy signed them to his Ruthless Records label. Eazy had tickets ready for them the next morning to return to L.A. to begin recording their debut EP.</p>

<h2>Wu-Tang Clan</h2>

<p>The first Wu-Tang Clan single, the hard-hitting "Protect Ya Neck," appeared on their own independent label and became an underground hit. Soon, record labels were offering them lucrative contracts. The group held out until it landed a deal that would allow each member to record solo albums for whatever label he chose -- in essence, each rapper was a free agent. Loud/RCA agreed to the deal, and the band's debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), appeared in November 1993. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was both critically acclaimed and commercially successful; although its financial success wasn't immediate, it was the result of a slow build. "C.R.E.A.M.," released in early 1994, was the single that put them over the top and won them a devoted following. The group wasted no time in pursuing other projects, as a total of five of the members -- GZA, RZA, Raekwon, Method Man, and Ol' Dirty Bastard -- landed solo contracts as a result of the success of "C.R.E.A.M. </p>
